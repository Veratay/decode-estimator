{"id":"decode-estimator-ama","title":"Release build memory corruption in bearing factor tests","notes":"All tests pass in Debug mode. Release mode crashes with 'double free or corruption'. Using gtsam::traits::Local for error computation and passing boost::optional\u003cMatrix\u0026\u003e directly to pose.bearing(). The crash happens when evaluateError() returns a gtsam::Vector. Valgrind shows invalid free of Eigen matrix data pointer. Likely compiler optimization issue with Eigen return value optimization or ABI mismatch between GTSAM library and our code.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-04T20:20:57.303799785-05:00","created_by":"dolphinpod","updated_at":"2026-01-04T20:22:34.830733745-05:00"}
